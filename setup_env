✅ Project Setup & Compilation Summary (Windows 11 + w64devkit)
1. Install a C compiler with Make (w64devkit)

Windows does not include make or gcc, so we installed w64devkit, which includes:

gcc (C compiler)

make

gdb

Unix tools

portable terminal environment

Steps:

Go to the GitHub page:
skeeto/w64devkit → Releases

Download the correct file:
✔ w64devkit-x64-2.4.0.7z.exe

Run the .exe → it extracts a folder, e.g.:

C:\w64devkit


Inside that folder, you get:

w64devkit.exe       ← launch this terminal
bin/
gcc.exe
make.exe
...

2. Open the w64devkit environment

Double-click:

C:\w64devkit\w64devkit.exe


This opens a Unix-like terminal where gcc and make already work.

3. Navigate to the project folder

Your project is located at:

C:\Users\LordDrag\Desktop\Tp\prog C\PROJET_C


Because there is a space in the folder name (prog C), use quotes:

cd "/c/Users/LordDrag/Desktop/Tp/prog C/PROJET_C"


List files to confirm:

ls

4. Build the project using Make

Just run:

make


This compiles:

src/main.c

src/user.c

src/conversation_manager.c

and generates:

messenger.exe

5. Fix compilation warnings (optional)

We updated this line in main.c:

snprintf(new_conv.cnv_id, sizeof(new_conv.cnv_id), "%ld", time(NULL));


because %ld was incorrect on Windows.

Correct version:

snprintf(new_conv.cnv_id, sizeof(new_conv.cnv_id), "%lld", (long long)time(NULL));


After modifying code:

make clean   # if available
make

6. Run the program
Inside w64devkit:

Use Unix-style:

./messenger.exe createuser myuser mypassword123

In Windows CMD (without w64devkit):

Skip the ./:

messenger.exe createuser myuser mypassword123


or full path:

C:\Users\LordDrag\Desktop\Tp\prog C\PROJET_C\messenger.exe createuser myuser mypassword123
